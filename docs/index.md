# Simple Slack Agent Documentation

## Overview
This project is a Slack bot that interacts with an Ollama-based Large Language Model (LLM). It allows users to communicate with the LLM through Slack messages, maintaining separate conversation histories for each thread.
It also features an integrated search capability where the Slack bot can communicate with a dedicated `search_agent` via an A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol to perform web searches.
